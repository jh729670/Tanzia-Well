Predicting Functional Wells in Tanzia
Using Data from DrivenData.org to help to predict Functional wells, Non functional wells, and wells that need repair. I used several models to help predict which category that wells fell into to. I first used a neural netwrok to help predict well types, but I was only getting 70% accuracy and the model was doing a poor job of classifying wells that need repair. 
To help improve accurarcy I decided to add the longitude and latitude of the wells to help the models. I decided to use Kmeans classification of the well location to assign each well a category based upon each well's distance to the nearest centroid. Using Grid Search and Random serach for Random Forest and Neural Network, accuracy imporved slightly to about 71%, but the models did a much better job of classifying wells that need repair.
Lastly, in one last attempt to imporve accuracy I used one-hot encoding on the target variables. I ran a Rnadom Forest Classifier on the data and accuracy did not imporve. 
Of all of the models that were created, the Random Forest Classifier with the geo locatiosn performed the best with 71.4% accuracy and the ability to classify wells that need repairs.
